## Installation

```
npm install letterboxd-client
```

## Usage

```js
import Client from 'letterboxd-client';
// const { default: Client } = require('letterboxd-client')

const apiKey = 'your letterboxd api key';
const apiSecret = 'your letterboxd api secret';

const client = new Client(apiKey, apiSecret);
const { status, data } = await client.film.get('ljDs');

console.log(data.name) // RRR
console.log(data.tagline) // Rise Roar Revolt
```

### User Authentication

To authenticate a user you will need their Letterboxd credentials (`username` + `password`), which you will supply to `client.auth.requestAuthToken` like so:

```js
const { status, data } = await client.auth.requestAuthToken(username, password);
```

If successful you will receive back an `AccessToken` response that will contain the users `acessToken` that you can then pass back into the main `Client` instance in order to authenticate all API requests as that user.
